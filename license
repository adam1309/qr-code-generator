In your **actual** GitHub repo, the top of `README.md` will usually display any badges (e.g., build status, license, coverage) if you set them up.

# Putting It All Together

1. **Create the folder structure** on your local machine (or initialize a new GitHub repo).
2. **Copy/paste** the file contents above into the appropriate files.
3. **Commit and push** to GitHub.

Now you have a **fully functional** Python package that:

1. Installs dependencies from `requirements.txt` or via `setup.py`.  
2. Offers a function (`generate_qr`) to create QR codes.  
3. Includes a `README.md` that documents usage and installation instructions.

When someone clones your repo, they can either run `python -m qr_code_gen.generate_qr` from the command line or import the function directly into their own code.
